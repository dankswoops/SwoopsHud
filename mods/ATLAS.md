# MODS ATLAS


## INSTRUCTONS
To activate a mod.vpk, move it from  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\SwoopsHud\mods`
to  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom`
and that's it.  

Casual Compatible means that it works with the SwoopsHud build in preloader.  
To activate the preloader to see mods in casual, go to  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\swoopshud\cfg\valve.rc`  
and uncomment the last line  
`//exec autopreloader` to `exec autopreloader`  
This will make you game take much longer on first load and `SwoopsHud\scripts\vscript` contains the known  bugs of preloading inside author.txt
