# SwoopsHud v0.99 (Pre-Release)
SwoopsHud is a user interface for the game team fortress 2.  
This is the first HUD trying to achieve customizing all aspects of the game that can be modified for the end user so they don't have to know anything and have a noticable advantage.
In the current day, many HUDs have zero styling on the main menu and associated panels along with having broken panels that require you to remove your HUD to add or remove a name tag, spell, part, etc.
Only a few HUDs have a cvar control panel, the intergration of a speedometer, transparent viewmodels, and base file intergration.

SwoopsHud offers more than the normal hud by:
1. Making the first complete set of default +12 button mouse binds with all class cfgs that have the best possible bind logic perclass.
1. Nearly all of main menu content is stylized and optimized for daily use.
1. All panels accesible and fully functional. (excluding Stats, fix coming soon)
1. The pre-loader was absorbed into the hud with pre-packaged mods the player can easily access to allow for a one line toggle.
1. The HUD has a built in music player and map selector. (58/107 maps unable to be upload due to github size limitations, $60/y to fix)
1. The HUD has a built in AutoUpdater with working version control for effortless updating.
1. Base File Intergration aka Hot Swaping is enabled allowing the user to toggle between default, swoopshud, and other huds later on.
1. A cvar control page with commands worth toggling, speedometer, and transparent viewmodels are already baked in.
2. 1. listenserver.cfg has been optimzed for the best local host experience.
1. (Soon) The hud will have a complete Config allowing you to hotswap best or worst performance. Users no longer need other configs. (cfg/ATLAS.cfg I've almost compiled all 4,000+ commands and created the update)
1. (Soon) The skybox give you extended controls for all bots, replays, and demos. Made for competition reviewers, youtubers, & advanced users.



# How to delete TF2 and reinstall the right way
Doing a fresh install can be a great way to verify no extra files are in the file path.  
Before you delete the game and file path, it's import you navigate to  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\media`
and copy your `viewed.res` file as this holds the local data of how many times you've played a map.  

To uninstall `Steam Client Library > Right Click Team Fortress 2 > Manage > Uninstall`  

Now travel to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common` and verify `Team Fortress 2` is deleted.  

To reinstall `Steam Client Library > Click Team Fortress 2 > Install`

Now we need to verify the game files `Steam Client Library > Right Click Team Fortress 2 > Properties > Installed files > Verify integrity of the game files`  

Remember to drop `viewed.res` back in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\media`

/// ON LOCAL SERVER LOAD:  LISTENSERVER.CFG
/// ON CLASS SELECTION:    AUTOBIND.CFG > CLASSNAME.CFG



# Bindings and all class cfg files



# How to setup a 12 button mouse
This hud was built around having a RedDragon M913 mouse with 12 hotkeys.  
If you're going to play a game, it's really worth having this mouse and binds.  
The mouses software and mouse premade settings will be in the "mouse" folder
