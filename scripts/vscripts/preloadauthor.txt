KNOWN BUGS: 
-Saxton Hale mods reset if you join any map that isn't VSH
-Long startup time, if game stops responding click "wait for this program to respond"
-MvM Victory screen is gray and doesn't work sometimes, type hud_reloadscheme while playing MvM to fix
-Mysterious and elusive missing eyes bug that causes severe lag, trying running the .Cache Cleaner.bat

Extra modding notes for newbies:
-Mods take priority by alphabetical order. A mod named Amymod.vpk will load on top of a mod named Zmymod.vpk
-Some mods come in folders instead of .vpks, these folders need to be installed correctly for mods to load.
-Particle mods (toon FX, etc.) won't work in Casual
-Clicking through the folders should look like: Team Fortress 2/tf/custom/cool mod/
 There is usually a folder called "models" and/or "materials" inside the "cool mod" folder
 Make sure your folders *DONT* look like: Team Fortress 2/tf/custom/cool mod/cool mod/ or else they won't load.
