    //net_chan_limit_msec "100" // BREAKS CONNECTION!!! helps prevent network channels from being tied up for too long, which can lead to latency and other network-related issues. The value represents the time in milliseconds
    //net_compresspackets "1" // enables packet compression, which can reduce the size of network packets and improve network performance
    //net_compresspackets_minsize "512" // sets the minimum size in bytes for a packet to be considered for compression. Only packets larger than this size will be compressed if packet compression is enabled. The value represents the packet size in bytes. 512 would set the minimum size to 512 bytes
